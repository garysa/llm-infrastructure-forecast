# LLM Forecast Project

## Purpose
Discussion notes and analysis on LLM infrastructure trends.

## Topics Covered
1. TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) - Google's custom ML accelerator
2. ASIC vs GPU dominance in AI compute
3. Enterprise LLM deployment patterns (hybrid private/public model)
4. Bitcoin ASIC analogy - comparing hardware evolution patterns
5. Fragmented AGI future - data sovereignty forces tiered model
6. Power bottleneck - China vs US/West 7-year race scenario
7. Scaling limits - Moore's Law parallel, what if AGI doesn't scale
8. Data wall - training data exhaustion, synthetic data collapse
9. Sector evolution - Cloud vs Local by year (2026-2029) with country breakdown
10. Summary & Conclusion - 5-year forecast, AGI probability (~12% by 2031)
